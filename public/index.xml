      <title>Covid-Themed Halloween Poster</title>

      <description>Covid-19 is a lethal pandemic, and our thoughts go out to those who have lost loved-ones or livelihoods to the disease.
That said, this is a special time of year, so we felt appropriate to give coronavirus a halloweenesque (halloweenable, halloweenish?) treatment. We’re going to make a Halloween poster featuring the virus, and we’re going to do it with magick. Of course.
Materials and Methods Fonts: the run-of-the-mill fonts just don’t quite do it for halloween.</description>

      <title>Tennis Sets - Jimmy&#39;s Theorem</title>

      <description>The Concept Our tennis coach has a theory. As well as being a teacher and player he’s also an avid follower of the game. And he reckons that an inordinate amount of competitive, two-set tennis matches finish with a closely matched first set followed by a relative blow out in the second. 7-5, 6-2 just about covers it.
Jimmy’s thinking is that a player who loses the first set, however close it was, will try to change things up to rescue the match.</description>

      <title>Where to find your Genes</title>

      <description>We’ve been working with the genetics of schizophrenia, looking at how the expression of genes that play a role in the condition vary across brain regions and neurodevelopment stages. Now, call me old-fashioned, but I like to know how things are laid out, so in this case where these genes are situated. Time for a plot.
The genes in question come from a GWAS study of the PGC. The images are build based on the ggbio and karyoploteR packages from bioconductor.</description>

      <description>My name is Eugene. I’m a researcher an lecturer at the Technological University Dublin. My speciality is data science, specifically data science using the R programming language. Current projects include work in neuroscience and astrophysics, but I’m also involved in a range of topics from cancer research to clinical trials data to sports science. My favourite course to lecture is data visualisation, and within that my favourite element is mapping.</description>
