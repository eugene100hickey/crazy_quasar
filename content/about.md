My name is Eugene. I'm a researcher an lecturer at the Technological University Dublin. My speciality is data science, specifically data science using the R programming language. Current projects include work in neuroscience and astrophysics, but I'm also involved in a range of topics from cancer research to clinical trials data to sports science. 
My favourite course to lecture is data visualisation, and within that my favourite element is mapping.
