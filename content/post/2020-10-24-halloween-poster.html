<p>Covid-19 is a lethal pandemic, and our thoughts go out to those who have lost loved-ones or livelihoods to the disease.<br />
That said, this is a special time of year, so we felt appropriate to give coronavirus a halloweenesque (halloweenable, halloweenish?) treatment. We’re going to make a Halloween poster featuring the virus, and we’re going to do it with magick. Of course.</p>
<div id="materials-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong>: the run-of-the-mill fonts just don’t quite do it for halloween. So we turned to <a href="https://www.fonts4free.net/fonts-by-sinister-fonts.html">fonts4free</a> and their line-up of sinister fonts. <em>Ghastly Panic</em> and <em>Gypsy Curse</em>, and <em>Fiendish</em> looked about right, with an honourable mention to <em>October Crow</em>. The <em>extrafont</em> package is pretty good at handling the installation of new fonts, but for these three I just downloaded the .ttf files and put them in my .fonts directory.<br />
<strong>Background</strong>: There are lots corona posters out there. We chose one from the <a href="www.hse.ie">Health Service Executive</a> here in Ireland. We downloaded it and put it in a local directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-code" class="section level2">
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>First we put in place the libraries we’ll need:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(magick)
library(showtext)
library(emojifont)
library(here)</code></pre>
<p><code>tidyverse</code> is an ever present, <code>magick</code> does the heavy lifting, <code>showtext</code> to access the new fonts, <code>emojifont</code> to get some Halloween icons, and <code>here</code> because it is so useful.<br />
Next we’ll load up those fonts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>font_add(&quot;Ghastly Panic&quot;, &quot;/home/eugene/.fonts/Font1/Ghastly Panic.ttf&quot;)
font_add(&quot;Gypsy Curse&quot;, &quot;/home/eugene/.fonts/Font2/Gypsy Curse.ttf&quot;)
font_add(&quot;Fiendish&quot;, &quot;/home/eugene/.fonts/Font3/Fiendish.ttf&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can start to build our poster. We use <code>magick</code> to read in the hse image file. It initially has a white border that is then cropped out. On top on this we place a yellow block to cover existing <em>Coronavirus</em> and <em>Covid-19</em> text (we had discerned the exact shade of yellow beforehand, thank you <code>colorfindr</code>). Then we replace these with the same text in our Halloween fonts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>corona &lt;- image_read(&quot;/home/eugene/Desktop/Elaine/covid.jpg&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_crop(&quot;625x900+185+50&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_draw()
# get rid of existing text by putting colour blocks over them
rect(xleft = 0, ybottom = 150, xright = 400, ytop = 0, border = NA, col = &quot;#FFEE00&quot;)
rect(xleft = 80, ybottom = 850, xright = 545, ytop = 680, border = NA, col = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;)
# add new text in appropriate fonts
text(x = 200, y = 100, family = &quot;Gypsy Curse&quot;, cex = 8,
     label = &quot;Coronavirus&quot;)
text(x = 130, y = 200, family = &quot;Ghastly Panic&quot;, cex = 6, 
     label = &quot;Covid-19&quot;)
text(x = 312, y = 825, adj = c(0.5, 0), family = &quot;Fiendish&quot;, cex = 2,
     label = &quot;Remember\n\nTo keep 2m apart\n\nin the seating area&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next up we use <code>emojifont</code> to make some extra graphics featuring halloween stuff. In this case <em>spiders</em>, <em>bats</em>, and <em>skulls</em>, but <code>emojofont::search_emoji(str = "")</code> shows that are far more available. The original graphics had an annoying border top and left, <code>image_crop()</code> was used to erase these.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spider &lt;- image_graph(width = 300, height = 400, res = 50)
ggplot() + 
  geom_emoji(&quot;spider&quot;, color=&#39;black&#39;) + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;#FFEE00&quot;))
spider &lt;- image_crop(spider, &quot;299x399+1+1&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_scale(50)

bat &lt;- image_graph(width = 300, height = 400, res = 50)
ggplot() + 
  geom_emoji(&quot;bat&quot;, color=&#39;black&#39;) + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;#FFEE00&quot;))
bat &lt;- image_crop(bat, &quot;299x399+1+1&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_scale(50)

skull &lt;- image_graph(width = 300, height = 400, res = 50)
ggplot() + 
  geom_emoji(&quot;skull&quot;, color=&#39;black&#39;) + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;)) 
skull &lt;- image_crop(skull, &quot;299x399+1+1&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_scale(50)</code></pre>
<p>And finally to the complete poster, adding in our <code>emojifont</code> graphics. The exact position took a bit of trial and error.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>corona %&gt;% image_composite(spider) %&gt;% 
  image_composite(bat, offset = &quot;+200&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_composite(skull, offset = &quot;+150+270&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_composite(skull, offset = &quot;+422+270&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Hope you like it.<br />
Happy Halloween everyone, and stay safe.</p>
